# This file contains on the phase and the goal of the phase.

Current Phase -- PHASE 1 

Trying to have a backup power source within which kicks in once the
car power is turned of. This would give PI enough time to save all the work 
and exit in a gracefull manner with out corrupting files.


Current Plan of action is use a electronic relay and generate a pulse for 
GPIO pin to detect.
Once pin is high , we should know that we pool for 30 sec(default) and see state does 
not change. If state does not change we initiale gracefull shutdown.
